# term-use

term-use is an evidence-driven CLI that gives your coding agents complete control
over **interactive terminal programs** — shells, nano/vim, REPLs, animated TUIs
(ink / bubbletea), even nested tmux — and replaces guessing with proof. Built
agent-first, in the spirit of open-source AI-skill projects like
[superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) and
[anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills): the docs are written *for
the agent*, the CLI is the tool interface, and every answer comes with evidence
attached.

## How it works

It starts the moment your agent needs to know something stdout can't tell it: *"did
the command finish?" "what was the exit code?" "which row is selected in that TUI?"*
Instead of blind `sleep`s and screen-scraping prayers, your agent drives the program
inside a real tmux pane and gets verdicts, not vibes:

- Every `wait` returns a verdict with a **confidence level** — `fact` (terminal
  protocol: OSC 133 shell integration, pane death) beats `inference` (screen regex,
  echo-aware) beats `heuristic` (animation-immune quiet sampling).
- Every failure returns **single-line structured JSON** with a screen snapshot
  attached. Timeouts never kill the target — they return evidence.
- A full **protocol-level recording** (`raw.log`, asciicast v2) of every session is
  kept on disk as ground truth: injections, output bytes, sync points.

Because skills trigger by description, your agent doesn't need special instructions —
it reads [the skill](skills/debugging-interactive-terminals/SKILL.md) and just works.

## Installation

term-use is **two parts**: the `term-use` CLI and the
`debugging-interactive-terminals` agent **skill**. Install both.

**Automatic (recommended for agents).** Point your agent at the install doc and let it
do the work — paste this into Claude Code / CodeBuddy / Codex / Cursor / any agent
that can read a file or URL. Repo: **https://github.com/uobe1/term-use**

```text
Read docs/en/installation.md in the term-use repo
(https://github.com/uobe1/term-use) and install term-use by following it:
install the `term-use` CLI and the `debugging-interactive-terminals` skill into
my agent. Tell me what you did.
```

If the agent can only fetch URLs (not local files), use the raw link instead:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uobe1/term-use/main/docs/en/installation.md`.

**Manual.** Open [docs/en/installation.md](docs/en/installation.md) and run the steps
yourself (CLI + skill); the doc is written so an AI agent or a human can follow it
end-to-end.

**Requirements:** Python **3.14+** (stdlib only) and **tmux 3.x** on `PATH`; Pillow
optional (screenshots only).

## The agent skill

The repo ships `skills/debugging-interactive-terminals/` — an agent-facing manual of
usage patterns and hard-won pitfalls. It is installed automatically as part of
[Installation](#installation) (copied/linked into your agent's skills directory) and
triggers by description, so your agent just works. Read it standalone:
[SKILL.md](skills/debugging-interactive-terminals/SKILL.md).

## The basic workflow

```bash
term-use start -n demo --cmd bash --width 100 --height 30
term-use wait  -n demo --shell-ready --timeout 10
term-use send  -n demo --type "make build" --key Enter
term-use wait  -n demo --cmd-done --expect-code 0 --timeout 120
# → {"verdict": "met", "confidence": "fact", "exit_code": 0, ...}
```

That's the whole loop: *start → shell-ready → send → wait for fact → act*. The
wait engine also speaks regex (`--until`), quiet detection (`--quiet-ms`), pane
death (`--exit`), AND-composition, and SGR mouse (`click X Y`); `send` handles
debounced key rhythms (`--repeat N --delay S`) and `screen --find` turns text
into 1-based click-ready coordinates.

**Detailed docs:** [docs/en/usage.md](docs/en/usage.md) — the agent-facing usage guide:
mental model, decision tables, worked examples, common mistakes, red lines.

## Architecture

```
agent → term-use CLI (stateless client) → tmux server → pane (target program)
                                              └→ pipe.py (recorder sink, one per pane)
```

Service/Client split: the CLI is a short-lived, stateless client with zero resident
memory; the tmux server is the service owning PTYs/sessions. All state lives on disk
under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/term-use/<session>/` — `raw.log` (asciicast v2 evidence
store) and `state.json` (atomic locator/recorder state, with `last_send_offset` as a
**byte offset** into `raw.log`, so echo can never fake completion).

Key internal guarantees: text/keys never mixed in one `send-keys` call; `--hex`
split one byte per `-H`; OSC 133 A/B/C/D state machine tolerates chunk boundaries;
composite verdicts take the weakest member's confidence; every failure surfaces as a
fixed-code `TDError`, single-line JSON, exit code 1.

## Testing

```bash
# Unit tests — pure asserts, each file runs standalone
python3 tests/unit/test_errors.py
python3 -m pytest tests/unit/

# E2E — standalone bash scripts driving real tmux + real programs (no mocks)
bash tests/e2e/01_start_stop.sh
for t in tests/e2e/*.sh; do bash "$t" || break; done
```
